### What is Quiver?
Quiver is a resource pack creator and manager for Minecraft.

### How does it work?
- First, you need to have Minecraft installed.
- Second, you need to select the version of Minecraft you would like your pack to be based on.
- Third, you need to press the "Create" button.
- After doing the first three steps, the program will extract everything needed for a resource pack from the selected versions' .jar.
- The pack will have opened in the editor and you can browse through everything inside the pack and edit and delete any file you'd like.
- Clicking on an item will show its' source on the right in a panel, no matter if it's an image file or a .mcmeta/.json file.

### What can it do?
- Generate a resource pack from any version of Minecraft.
- Show every file from the resource pack in the tree.
- Show what's contained in each file in a panel on the left (if it's an image, the image is shown with a chessboard background, if it's code, the code is shown with syntax highlighting)

### What are the requirements?
All you need is to have Minecraft installed and have run it once (to generate the versions folder).

### How do I download and run it (Windows)?
Download the .zip file and extract the sub-file, "Quiver". Do not delete anything from the sub-folder. Right-click and open "Quiver.exe", and you can now start making resource packs.

---

### Planned Features:
- File selector before extraction (in case you don't want your pack to have everything)
- More items for the menus.
- More uses for properties.json.
- Resource Pack opener.
- A resource pack patcher.
- A theme designer/editor for the SAO-UI mod.
- Add an option to create the pack as a folder or `.zip` file.

### Bugs:
- Syntax highlighting for strings carries on until the final quotation is found.

I would greatly appreciate if you'd star the repository.
