# Contributing

When contributing code to this repository, please first open an issue, discussing the change you would like to make.
Please only make one change per pull request.

Before submitting a pull request, if you are adding a new plugin, make sure you want it in the main repository rather than its own.

If you decide to close your pull request for a new plugin as you would rather have it in a different repository, please comment on the issue with a reference to its new home, so it may be added to the README.

Should you decide you want your code removed in the future, if there isn't code elsewhere in this repository that depends on it, it will be removed from future releases.
If your removed code was a plugin, and it has a new home, please submit an issue with a reference to it so it may be added to the README.
